Based on the science of perception and vision, the author presents the key principles at work for a wide range of applications--resulting in visualization of improved clarity, utility, and persuasiveness. The book offers practical guidelines that can be applied by anyone: interaction designers, graphic designers of all kinds (including web designers), data miners, and financial analysts.*First work to use the science of perception to help serious designers and analysts optimize understanding and perception of their data visualizations.* Major revision of this classic work, with a new chapter on visual thinking, new sections on face perception and flow visualization, and a much expanded chapter on color and color sequences. *New to this edition is the full color treatment throughout, to better display over 400 illustrations.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we propose a solution for the identification of the dominant colors in pictures taking into account the way people perceive them. To that end we developed an algorithm based on a reduced palette of 12 colors and on a non-uniform segmentation of the HSV color space using fuzzy membership functions. Experimental results from an evaluation with users, showed that our algorithm based on the fuzzy histogram is able to identify the same three dom- inant colors as users in 50% of the cases, while the classic histogram is only able to identify 43%.},

  abstract ={The nature of color categories in the world's languages is contested. One major view holds that color categories are organized around universal focal colors, whereas an opposing view holds instead that categories are defined at their boundaries by linguistic convention. Both of these standardly opposed views are challenged by existing data. Here, we argue for a third view based on a proposal by Jameson and D'Andrade [Jameson KA, D'Andrade RG (1997) in Color Categories in Thought and Language, eds Hardin CL, Maffi L (Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, U.K.), pp 295–319]: that color naming across languages reflects optimal or near-optimal divisions of an irregularly shaped perceptual color space. We formalize this idea, test it against color-naming data from a broad range of languages and show that it accounts for universal tendencies in color naming while also accommodating some observed cross-language variation.},
