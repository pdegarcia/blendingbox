\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
	\item \textbf{Questions raised Before}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
			\item Will perceived colors correspond to a particular fixed angular value, in the color wheel?
      \item Which is the best formula to blend colors, in each color model? Is it linear interpolation or another?
      \item In the case in which 3 colors are blended, do observers realize all colors at the same time or do they decompose the mixture, firstly in a mixture of two colors and then a blending of a third color?
      \item What is the best way to present color, without influencing color perception?
      \item Does the user \emph{really} understands which colors are involved in a mixing?
		\end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Perception Questions}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
    	\item Does the order in which colors are mixed, influence mental mixing models? Are there common patterns among mixing orders?
      \item Do shapes and proximity, influence how color is perceived?
      \item Until which extent does background influence the perception of a subject, in particular a blended color?
      \item If color parameters like Saturation, Value or Luminance change in a blending, does it modify color blending perception?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Information Visualization Questions}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
		\item Do continuous scales yield better results than discrete color scales?
        \item What is the influence of nominal color scales in perception?
        \item What are the results if no color scale is presented to guide the user?
	\end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cultural Questions}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
		\item Does the gender really influences how the color is perceived? Is it possible to observe a significant gap between male and female answers?
\item Is it possible to observe significant differences in observation, depending on user's cultural background?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize} \par

Although there are these questions whose answers remains to be found, only a portion of them will meet their answers, since this is Master Thesis Research Problem. However, there is a set of these questions which was considered crucial and, consequently, had more priority above others: it was this set which was the focus of our studies. We intended to perform \textbf{three studies} and, in the following sections, it is covered the entire proposal for the first study, the conditions in which the study is ideally performed and other important details.
